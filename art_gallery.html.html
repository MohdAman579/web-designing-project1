      <b>The phrase "art is everywhere" highlights that artistic expression and beauty can be found not just in traditional galleries, but also in everyday objects, nature, and human creations, from the design of a soup can or a cereal box to the music we listen to and the stories we share. This concept encourages a different way of seeing the world, where ordinary things can be viewed as special and art can be a part of everyone's experience, fostering creativity and empathy.  </b>
      <h2>Art is present in everything</h2>

          <b>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty.[4][5] Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</b>
